# Data for Research agreement questionnaire - JSTOR

## 1. Project Description
 
We are interested in conducting a study evaluating trends in major themes in
the fields of ecology and conservation biology. 

TODO

The JSTOR Data for Research service would be ideal as it includes the widest
range of journals within our fields of interest over the longest timespan.

## 2. Source of the grant funding and details about the grant:

We are all postdoctoral researchers funded by the David H. Smith Conservation
Research Fellowship Program hosted by the Society for Conservation Biology.

## 3. What is the nature of the Data to be provided?  

[x] Quadgrams

## 4. What is the scope and nature of the Data to be provided?  

*JSTOR Search URL:*

E.g.
<http://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=jo%3AScience+OR+jo%3AAmbio+OR+jo%3AEcology+OR+jo%3A%22Journal+of+Animal+Ecology%22>

## 5. Please confirm the parameters of your dataset:

*The dataset will be limited to these publication dates:*

All available publication dates for the journals listed in the search URL. 

*The dataset will be limited to these journals:*

All journals listed in the search URL. The following is a complete list of these journals:




*If your query will be limited in some other way, please describe:*

English? Anything else? 

## 6. "Key researchers" and their affiliation:

*Others, if any, who are expected to have access to the Data (for example,
graduate students or undergraduates)? Will other outside third parties require
access to the Data? Please explain.*

Although we expect other researchers (largely from the same postdoctoral
fellowship program) to be involved with research question development,
interpreting the results, and writing any subsequent papers, none of these
collaborating scientists or any other third parties will require access to the
raw data itself. 

## 7. Use of the Data - check all that apply:*
