## A: Models for inference

- 'Regression' saw continued and rapid growth in use from the 1930s until the late 2000s approaching 'correlation' [thought: it's possible we should remove correlation since it is used a lot in contexts beyond models for inference]
- References to 'ANOVA' began in substantial quantity in the mid 1970s and peaked around 2000 with a rapid decline from 2000--2010
- References to generalized linear models (GLMs) have steadily increased and surpassed the frequency of 't-test' as of 2007(?), which has been declining in use since around 2000

## B: Modelling paradigms

- Although 'least-squares' has been steadily increasing in use since the beginning of the corpus in 1930, it was rapidly surpassed by Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and information theoretic terms in ~2000
- 'maximum likelihood' used to be used more frequently than 'Bayesian', but as of ~2000, 'Bayesian' terms surpassed 'maximum likelihood'
- As of 2010, 'Bayesian' terms were used approximately twice as often as the phrase 'maximum likelihood'
- The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach 'MCMC' first appears in 1992(?) and saw a rapid increase through to the end of the corpus in 2010

## C: Statistical significance

- (TODO: add 'statistical significance' itself?)
- Some sentence about endless debates on statistical significance in the ecology literature
- Use of the phrase 'null hypothesis' peaked in the 1980s and the phrase 'significant difference' peaked in use around 1990 and has declined since
- 'p-value' and 'confidence interval' appeared in equal frequency as of 2010, although both are often referred to by abbreviations that would be missed in our corpus (e.g. 'p = ' or 'CI').
- 'power analysis' remains a rarely used phrase despite numerous pleas by ecological statisticians of its importance (REF)

## D: Supporting information

- 'supplementary material', 'supporting information', and 'SOM' (collectively shown as 'supplementary material') have seen a meteoric rise since around 2000, likely coinciding with the rise of the Internet and online journal publishing
- this rise has coincided with a decline in the term 'unpublished data'
